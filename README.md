Screentop Monitor
=================

This little project is a frame for a small monitor that can be placed your main monitor's upper edge, leaving a gap for you webcam.

The monitor is useful for video calls or just your todo list - or any other small windows you'd like to have on a small, separate screen.

The frame consists of two poles and to legs, one set for each side. The pole has a little bracket on it's foo that stops the monitor for falling backwards, where the leg supports the pole from behind. When fixed to the display, the setup is quite stable.

To build, you need:
* A Waveshare LCD Display 7 inch display like the [7inch HDMI LCD (C)](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/lcd-oled/lcd-oled-1/7inch-hdmi-lcd-c.htm?___SID=U), or one that fits the measurements
* 3D prints from [waveshare-display-frame-pole.stl](waveshare-display-frame-pole.stl) and [waveshare-display-frame-leg.stl](waveshare-display-frame-leg.stl) - print them twice, you need one set for each side
* 4x screws to fix the frame to the display
* 2x screws and matching nuts to fix each leg to its pole
